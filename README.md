This code has been set-up for and tested on the Heroku platform.
We recommmend you stick to Heroku cause it's awesome.

2. python manage.py migrate

3. python manage.py loaddata primary/fixtures/your_data.yaml

4. install the summary view found in primary/models.py

5. python manage.py initial_vote #todo: change the view so this is not neccessary
