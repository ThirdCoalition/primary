  <p><b>Mission Statement</b> - The Third Party Coalition is primarily concerned with co-ordinating discussion between Third Parties and Independents. We are also on a mission to educate the public about Electoral Reform. Our first challenge is to disrupt the entrenched Two-Party System.</p>

  <p><b>About Us</b> - The Direct Democracy Party was founded by Andrew Warshaver and Jeffrey Schroder in late 2014. Our <a href="http://igg.me/at/ddp" target="_blank">Indiegogo Campaign</a> is still live. Read more about us on our <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xm1l6/" target="_blank">AMA</a>. The Third Party Coalition is an agile pivot from the original effort.</p>
