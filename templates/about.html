  <p>The Direct Democracy Party was co-founded by Andrew Warshaver and Jeffrey Schroder in late 2014. Our <a href="http://igg.me/at/ddp">Indiegogo Campaign</a> is still live. Read more about us on our <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xm1l6/">AMA</a>.</p>

  <p>Mission Statement - The Third Coalition is primarily concerned with co-ordinating discussion between Third Parties and Independents. We are also on a mission to educate the public about <a href="reform">Electoral Reform</a> Our first challenge is to defeat the entrenched Two-Party System.</p>

  <p>DDP Platform - Runs entirely on the principles of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_Vhldz-8">Liquid Democracy</a>. We'll utilize one of the emerging <a href="related#lf">discourse platforms</a> or build our own.</p>

  <p>Our Priorities - 1. Return to a Fluid Majority in the House. 2. Enshrine <a href="reform">Electoral Reform</a>. 3. Moderate and promote healthy discourse in Congress.</p>
