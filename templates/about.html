  <p>Reclaim Congress is primarily concerned with co-ordinating discussion between ordinary citizens across boundaries, both geographical and political. We are also on a mission to educate the public about Electoral Reform. Our first challenge is to disrupt the entrenched Two-Party System and other established bureaucracies.</p>

  <p>Reclaim Congress was founded in Late April, 2015</p>
