  <p><b>Your Platform</b> - We run entirely online, and entirely based on <b>your feedback</b>.

  <ol>
    <li><b>Moderation</b> - We intend to moderate discussion in Congress and force a return to rational discourse, with a focus on multi-partisan solutions and fact-checking.</li>

    <li><b>Transparency</b> - We would like to accelerate FOIA requests, install civilian oversight, and provide a safe framework that encourages responsible whistle-blowing.</li>

    <li><b>Campaign Finance Reform</b> - We will refuse all corporate donations over $1,000, instead relying on social media, viral marketing, and original content.</li>

    <li><b>Scientific Inquiry</b> - With a focus on keeping an open mind, sustainable living, and humane exploration.</li>

    <li><b>Ballot Access</b> - Our proposed solution is a <a href="/static/howtovote.png" target="_blank">hybrid</a> system.</li>

    <li><b>Hypothesis</b>: The #1 priority is to disrupt the Two-Party System and return to a fluid majority in Congress. This is the root cause of our government's dysfunction and this proposal will help illustrate that notion.</li>

    <li><b>Further Development</b> - I personally identify as Libertarian and Green. I believe in strong individual rights, strong state's rights, and sustainable living. For divisive issues, I intend to experiment with crowd-sourced solutions, notably: liquid feedback, loomio, and citizen juries. More on emerging <a href="related#lf">discourse platforms</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Branching</b> - You are encouraged to use any or all of this platform as a starting point for your own campaign. Everything is available in our <a href="https://github.com/ThirdCoalition/primary" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> under an MIT license.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Mission Statement</b> - The Third Coalition is primarily concerned with co-ordinating discussion between Third Parties and Independents. We are also on a mission to educate the public about <a href="reform">Electoral Reform</a>. Our first challenge is to defeat the entrenched Two-Party System.</p>

  <p><b>About Us</b> - The Direct Democracy Party (DDP) was founded by Andrew Warshaver and Jeffrey Schroder in late 2014. Our <a href="http://igg.me/at/ddp" target="_blank">Indiegogo Campaign</a> is still live. Read more about us on our <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xm1l6/" target="_blank">AMA</a>. The <b>Third Coalition</b> is an agile pivot from the original plan.</p>
